# Prerequisite Validator #
Application that acts as a course registration planning tool for Marist computer science students developed with Java and Eclipse.
## Abstract ##

Class registration can be a very stressful period for students, especially when there are so many high-level courses that require many different prerequisites. Without a proper application or system that will help students figure out if they had met their prerequisites requirements, registration can become a huge mess. Prerequisite Validator will help define whether or not a computer science student has met the requirements for a course that they are planning to take.
